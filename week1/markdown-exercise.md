### Blockquote

> My quote is not getting italicized, and the dash turns into a bullet point:
> 
>> Students today are facing information overload, contamination, and bloat from dubious sources: AI-generated content, masqueraded influencer opinions, context-less listicles, and consumer manipulation - frequently heralded by graphs and charts to bolster the argument. Because this information firehose presents as technical visual communications, the overload is both cognitive and perceptual, potentially causing more insidious misperceptions than text alone.
